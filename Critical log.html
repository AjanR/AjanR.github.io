	<p>Web standards or W3C standards allow a platform, open to all users on the web, to help developers build an application which allows them to create rich interactive experiences powered by vast data stores. This is available on any dice.
Although the limits for this platform are decreasing overtime due to continuous improvement, major leaders in the programming industry talk about how HTML5 (Hypertext Markup language) will be best suited for this platform even though the platform has not reached its full extent (working with CCS, SVG and a variety of APIs). The W3C mark-up validation is very important in ensuring the technical qualities of the web pages have reached near perfection with absolutely no errors or minimal errors, a set of recommendations is given to the user by the validator to ensure this, the user may or may not choose to correct the errors or follow the recommendations., if the user chooses to follow these set of recommendations t and is in conformity with the standards then it will allow the users website to remain viable in the future and provide a sufficient experience for people who use the website in the future.
Modern day web standards given by W3C allows the usage of HTML5 and CSS (cascading style sheets) for websites. HTML5 is used to create the foundation of the website by creating an overall structure for it. CSS3 is then used to design the website and change to overall look of it to make it more appealing to the user.
The website I created met the official standard as I used HTML5 and CSS3.

To enhance the responsiveness of my site I decided, I have applied several techniques such as creating the structure for a responsive deign in my html, I have also applied different values in my html and my CSS so that it will look best whatever the size or resolution of the screen. To ensure interoperability between browsers and my device I decided to place the navigation bar at the top of the page right under my header, the navigation bar is also contrasting with the background (white to black) this allows the user on the page to easily identify the navigation bar even on smaller screens and screens with a low resolution, this will enhance the user experience as well. I would have created a dropdown menu for my navigation bar, but I thought I may have been more intricate for the user to browse around my website.

Another best “web standard” that I have used is placing my logo(header) at the top of my web page above the navigation bar, this allows users who enter my website to immediately recognise the company, the logo(header) b I have eing at the top of the screen allows the user using small devices such as laptops to easily see what its about, its also better for users who have a low resolution screen who find it harder to view my website but because my logo(header) is at the top they can immediately differentiate that it is the logo .
Another good “ web standard I have used is” placing a call to action , for example on my homepage these is a search bar in the middle of the  of the page which allows the user to search up different items and what they need within the website, I have also written some text next to it which says “browse our range”, this is in order to make it easier and more understandable for the user as it tells the user what the search bar is for.
Web best practices

A good web practice I have used is making my website desktop friendly, as it will respond and adjust accordingly if you increase or decrease the height of the width it will also keep the same level of consistency and will make sure the user can still browse and interact with the webpage the same as it being the original size, I also made sure the size of the words are still the same size so the user can see it clearly and navigate in a proper way.
Moreover, I have also applied a search feature in the homepage which will allow the user to search for stuff in the website quickly and navigate through it thoroughly.
To stick to the theme of my brand I have used a consistent colour scheme in my CSS (silver, white and black) which applies in all my webpages, I have also made the font consistent as well, so it will be nice and simple for the user to understand.
The tone of my website in consistent throughout as well
